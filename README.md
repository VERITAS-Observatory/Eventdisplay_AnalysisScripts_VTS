# Eventdisplay Analysis Scripts for VERITAS

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/307321978.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/307321978)

Run scripts for VERITAS.

In version v483 and earlier, these scripts were part of the Eventdisplay package and in the scripts/VTS directory (e.g., https://github.com/VERITAS-Observatory/EventDisplay_v4/tree/v483/scripts/VTS).

Scripts are moved into this separate directory to make the migration to Eventdisplay v500 easier.

## Usage

Submission commands for a range of different batch systems can be found in [submissionCommands.dat](./scripts/submissionCommands.dat). Modify according to your local needs.
