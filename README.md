# Eventdisplay Analysis Scripts for VERITAS

Runscripts for VERITAS.

In version v483 and earlier, these scripts were part of the Eventdisplay package and in the scripts/VTS directory (e.g., https://github.com/VERITAS-Observatory/EventDisplay_v4/tree/v483/scripts/VTS).

Scripts are moved into this separate directory to make the migration to Eventdisplay v500 easier.
